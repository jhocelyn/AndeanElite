You will also appreciate the Cathedral and the Cloisters of the Society of Jesus. Next, visit the Santa Catalina Monastery, a former absolute cloister that remained closed to the public for centuries. Today, it has been beautifully restored and opened to the public, allowing visitors to experience what Arequipa was like in the 17th century. You will see its streets, gardens, cloisters, rustic stone wash basins, sillar walls, and its impressive art gallery. The tour continues to the beautiful green countryside of Carmen Alto and the Yanahuara Viewpoint, where you will have a privileged view of the city and the surrounding volcanoes, including Misti, Pichu Pichu, and Chachani.

The return trip to Chivay includes lunch (not included) and stops at strategic locations within the Salinas and Aguada Blanca National Reserve, such as Patapampa (the viewpoint of the volcanoes), the Tocra wetlands, and Pampa Cañahuas to observe vicuñas.

We will make a brief stop at the main square of Cayma District to appreciate its Plaza and Church. We continue our tour with a short stop at a viewpoint to see the three volcanoes surrounding Arequipa: Misti, Chachani, and Pichupichu. Then, we will arrive at the Añashuayco Quarry, where you can see the quarry in operation, learn about the sillar extraction process, and witness the craftsmanship of the master stonecutters. The tour continues to the Culebrillas Ravine, where we will take a 20-minute walk through a small canyon formed by water erosion, with walls ranging from 15 to 20 meters high. As we walk, the walls grow taller, leading to ancient petroglyphs created by the Wasi Culture. At the end of the tour, we will observe the Apachetas, stone formations stacked on top of each other, symbolizing gratitude to nature and attracting good fortune, creating a mystical atmosphere.
