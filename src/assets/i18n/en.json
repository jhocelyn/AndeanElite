You will see its streets, gardens, cloisters, rustic stone wash basins, sillar walls, and its impressive art gallery. The tour continues to the beautiful green countryside of Carmen Alto and the Yanahuara Viewpoint, where you will have a privileged view of the city and the surrounding volcanoes, including Misti, Pichu Pichu, and Chachani. Overnight in Arequipa."

We continue our tour with a short stop at a viewpoint to see the three volcanoes surrounding Arequipa: Misti, Chachani, and Pichupichu. Then, we will arrive at the Añashuayco Quarry, where you can see the quarry in operation, learn about the sillar extraction process, and witness the craftsmanship of the master stonecutters. The tour continues to the Culebrillas Ravine, where we will take a 20-minute walk through a small canyon formed by water erosion, with walls ranging from 15 to 20 meters high. As we walk, the walls grow taller, leading to ancient petroglyphs created by the Wasi Culture. At the end of the tour, we will observe the Apachetas, stone formations stacked on top of each other, symbolizing gratitude to nature and attracting good fortune, creating a mystical atmosphere.

      "text": "<p><strong>The best time to visit Machu Picchu depends on what you value most in your experience:</strong></p>\n\n  <p><strong>Dry season (April to October):</strong> Clear skies, ideal weather for hiking, and full access to trails. However, this is also the busiest time, especially from June to August, which includes events like Inti Raymi.</p>\n\n  <p><strong>Shoulder months (April–May and September–October):</strong> Mild weather, green landscapes, fewer tourists, and excellent conditions for exploring Machu Picchu and nearby mountains. These are often considered the best months to visit.</p>\n\n  <p><strong>Rainy season (November to March):</strong> Lush green scenery, warm temperatures, and fewer crowds. A calmer and more peaceful experience overall. Rain is frequent but often light. Note: the Inca Trail is closed in February for maintenance.</p>\n\n  <p><strong>Average temperatures:</strong></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Daytime temperatures range from 18 °C to 26 °C (64°F to 79°F) during the dry season.</li>\n    <li>Nights can be cold, especially at higher elevations (near freezing).</li>\n    <li>During the rainy season, daytime temperatures stay around 19 °C to 21 °C (66°F to 70°F), with more humidity.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p><strong>Tips to avoid crowds:</strong></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Avoid June, July, and August if you prefer a quieter visit.</li>\n    <li>Go early in the morning (6 a.m. to 8 a.m.) or after 3 p.m. for fewer people.</li>\n    <li>Book entrance tickets, train rides, and permits 2 to 4 months in advance.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p><strong>Important considerations:</strong></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The classic Inca Trail fills up quickly during peak season.</li>\n    <li>Some trails may be slippery or partially closed during the rainy season.</li>\n    <li>Alternative treks like Salkantay or Lares are great options to avoid crowds or wet trails.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p><strong>Final recommendations:</strong></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Spend a few days in Cusco before visiting to acclimatize to the altitude.</li>\n    <li>Bring waterproof clothing, good hiking shoes, and sun protection.</li>\n    <li>Choose your season based on your priorities—weather, crowd levels, or scenery.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Each season offers unique benefits. The shoulder months are a great balance. With good planning, any time can become a memorable experience.</p>\n"

These delegations symbolize the four suyus or quarters of the Inca Empire—Antisuyo (jungle), Chinchaysuyo (north), Collasuyo (south), and Contisuyo (west)—turning the festival into a living tribute to Tawantinsuyo’s political and cultural organization.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Government support:</strong> The event is organized by the Municipality of Dos de Mayo, in coordination with regional tourism and cultural authorities. It reflects a strong commitment to preserving intangible heritage and promoting local identity. Beyond a tourist attraction, Inti Raymi is a community-driven event that reinforces pride and intercultural dialogue among Peruvians.</li>\n</ul>\n"

Here’s a practical guide to help you understand this process better:</p> <ul> <li><strong>What is Ayahuasca?</strong> It is a traditional Amazonian brew made from the Banisteriopsis caapi vine and leaves containing DMT. This brew is used by Indigenous cultures for spiritual healing and connecting with ancestral worlds.</li> <li><strong>Preparation and ritual:</strong> Ceremonies usually take place at night in malocas or sacred spaces and are led by shamans. During the ceremony, icaros (chants), smoke cleansing, and purging are used to guide participants through intense visions lasting 4 to 8 hours.</li> <li><strong>Health and safety:</strong> Physical effects can include nausea, vomiting, and headaches. It is essential that ceremonies are conducted by trained facilitators with prior medical screening. Tourists should avoid mixing Ayahuasca with medications, as this can lead to overdoses or fatal interactions.</li> <li><strong>Risks and incidents:</strong> In recent years, tragic cases have been reported, such as the death of a U.S. tourist from organ failure after combining Ayahuasca with antibiotics, highlighting the need for caution and professional supervision.</li> <li><strong>Authenticity and ethics:</strong> The commercial boom has led to hundreds of retreat centers, some lacking integrity. It is crucial to research shamans, choose practitioners with traditional lineage, and avoid operations that exploit or cater solely to tourism without respect for tradition.</li> <li><strong>Cultural status:</strong> In Peru, traditional Ayahuasca use has been protected as Cultural Heritage since 2008, distinguishing it from unregulated commercial ceremonies and reinforcing its cultural and spiritual significance.</li> </ul>"

Florence, December 5, 1983.<br><br>\nLocated in the Cusco department, Urubamba province, Machu Picchu district, between the Cusichaca and Aobamba rivers, tributaries of the Vilcanota River, at the meeting point of the Peruvian Andes and the Amazon basin. The Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu is one of the greatest artistic and architectural achievements and the most significant tangible legacy of the Inca civilization, covering 32,592 hectares of slopes, peaks, and valleys surrounding the archaeological monument of the Citadel at over 2,400 meters above sea level. Machu Picchu was abandoned at the beginning of the 16th century when the Inca Empire was conquered by the Spanish and was only rediscovered in 1911.<br><br>\nThe Inca City of the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu is a masterpiece of art, urbanism, architecture, and engineering of the Inca Civilization (Criterion (i)), with a well-planned distribution of functions within the space, territorial control, and social, productive, religious, and administrative organization (Criterion (iii)). The monuments and their historical features are immersed in a spectacular mountainous landscape of exceptional scenic beauty, showing a harmonious and aesthetic relationship between human culture and nature (Criterion (vii)). Covering part of the transition between the High Andes and the Amazon basin, the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu hosts a great variety of microclimates, habitats, and species of flora and fauna (Criterion (ix)).<br><br>\nIntegrity – The Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu meets the conditions of integrity, man-made natural attributes, and values that support its Outstanding Universal Value. The visual ensemble that links the archaeological site with its mountainous surroundings remains almost intact. It could be extended to include cultural sites such as Pisac and Ollantaytambo in the Sacred Valley, and part of the Urubamba river basin, which would contribute to strengthening overall integrity. In particular, the conservation of many species of flora and fauna, consisting of 401 species of birds, 19 reptiles, 10 amphibians, 13 fish, 300 diurnal butterflies, and 400 nocturnal ones; it also records 309 species of orchids out of the total 1,625 species existing in the country.<br><br>\nAuthenticity – After the abandonment of the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu, vegetation growth and isolation ensured the conservation of its architectural attributes. Although the design, materials, and structures have undergone slight changes due to fabric decomposition, authenticity conditions have not changed. The rediscovery in 1911 and subsequent archaeological excavations and conservation interventions have followed international practices and standards that have maintained the property's attributes.<br><br>\nProtection and Management Requirements – The Management Unit of the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu (UGM) was established in 1999 to implement the strategies contained in the Master Plans, which are regularly updated guiding documents for property management. The UGM was reactivated in 2011 and is composed of representatives from the Ministries of Culture, Environment, Foreign Trade and Tourism, the Regional Government of Cusco acting as President of the Executive Committee, and the local municipality of Machu Picchu.<br><br>\nDespite the adequate legal and formal management framework, challenges exist for inter-institutional governance and the effectiveness of management and property protection. For example, while tourism provides economic benefits, it also causes cultural and ecological impacts. The increasing number of visitors to the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu must be accompanied by adequate management that regulates access, diversifies offerings, and efforts to understand and minimize impact. Therefore, the evaluation and implementation of suggestions contained in the Reactive Monitoring Mission Report to the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu, conducted from February 22 to 25, 2017, led by César Moreno-Triana, Head of the Latin America and Caribbean Unit of the UNESCO World Heritage Centre, is particularly important.\n"

Doha, Qatar, June 21, 2014.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Qhapaq Ñan</strong> is an extensive Inca road system spanning over 30,000 kilometers, built by pre-Hispanic Andean cultures over several centuries. It reached its maximum expansion in the 15th century during the consolidation of the Tahuantinsuyo. It crosses six countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, and has four main routes originating from the central plaza of Cusco, the capital of the Inca Empire. These routes are connected with other roads, creating links and connections supported by associated infrastructure for trade, storage, and lodging.<br><br>\n\nThe Qhapaq Ñan was the road that united cities, cults, and production centers for several centuries. It represents a unique engineering achievement in a geographic terrain that links the snow-capped Andes Mountains—at altitudes over 6,600 meters (21,650 feet) above sea level—with the fertile valleys of the Amazon basin. The integration of ancestral knowledge from Andean communities and cultures enabled the exchange of social, political, and economic values. Several structures along the road provide evidence of valuable resources and goods traded such as precious metals, <em>muyu</em> (Spondylus shell), food, military supplies, feathers, wood, coca, and textiles transported from areas where they were gathered, produced, or manufactured, to Inca centers and the capital (<strong>Criterion (ii)</strong>).<br><br>\n\nThe Qhapaq Ñan was the vital backbone of the Inca Empire and a symbol of its strength and extent (<strong>Criterion (iii)</strong>). Various elements illustrate characteristic typologies in terms of walls, roads, steps, road trenches, wastewater pipes, drainage systems, etc., with exclusive construction methods varying according to location and regional context (<strong>Criterion (iv)</strong>). The Andean road system played an essential role in organizing space and society across a wide geographic area along the Andes, where roads were used as a means to share cultural values, provide communities with a sense of identity, and allow their cultural practices and expressions to continue being passed down through generations (<strong>Criterion (vi)</strong>).<br><br>\n\n<strong>Integrity.</strong> The series of inscribed Qhapaq Ñan sites illustrates the variety of typological, functional, and communicative elements that allow a comprehensive understanding of its historical and contemporary role. The number of segments is adequate to convey the main characteristics of the heritage route, despite being fragmented into individual components.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Authenticity.</strong> The Qhapaq Ñan sites preserve their features, form, design, and the variety of specific architectural and engineering types. The materials used are mainly stone and earth, with types varying regionally, and repair and maintenance measures are carried out with traditional techniques and materials. The Qhapaq Ñan crosses landscapes that need to be monitored to ensure that modern development does not cause visual impacts. Several sites are difficult to access, and their remoteness has kept them in good condition for centuries.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Protection and Management Requirements.</strong> Qhapaq Ñan crosses six countries that signed joint declarations between 2010 and 2012 for protection under their respective legislations. At national levels, management systems have been developed in cooperation with local communities, many of which expressed interest in tourism activities to be managed and conducted at the community level. Some Qhapaq Ñan territories are seismically active areas, and architectural structures could be endangered by earthquakes. Therefore, it is necessary to develop risk protection schemes to ensure the safety of people and cultural resources. On November 29, 2012, a general policy framework was established for Qhapaq Ñan with the Management Strategy document signed by the six States Parties. In addition to this multinational agreement, management plans will be developed at the regional level for each individual section of the road network. It was also recommended that the States Parties, aiming to ensure the relationship between different sites in terms of continuity despite fragmentation, develop appropriate maps or a GIS system illustrating the functional and social relationships between the different components of Qhapaq Ñan."

Likewise, human activity has not caused severe impact on the property, so the geoglyphs and cultural landscape have remained intact for nearly two millennia. However, the construction of the Pan-American Highway, which directly crosses the property, has caused damage in some sectors of the lines and figures.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Authenticity.</strong> The creation, design, morphology, size, and variety of the geoglyphs and lines correspond to the original designs produced during the historical evolution of the region and have remained unchanged. The ideology, symbolism, and sacred and ritual character of the geoglyphs and landscape are clearly represented, and their meaning remains intact to this day.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Protection and Management Requirements.</strong> The National Constitution (Article 36) and Law No. 28296, General Law of National Cultural Heritage, are the main legal protection standards for the Nasca and Palpa Lines and Geoglyphs. The boundaries of the protection area were established by Resolution No. 421 / INC as an Archaeological Reserve. Since 1941, foreign scientists, especially Dr. María Reiche, have conducted archaeological research, conservation, protection, and maintenance measures for the Nasca Lines and Geoglyphs. Management and protection are the responsibility of the Peruvian government represented by the Ministry of Culture. A management plan has been formulated and is being implemented for the entire area, which is fundamental for the protection of the Nasca and Palpa Lines and Geoglyphs.\n",

      "text":"<strong>Inscription:</strong> 24th Session of the World Heritage Committee. Cairns, Australia, November 27, 2000.<br><br>\n\nThe historic center of Arequipa represents a combination of native influences and Spanish construction features on unstable terrain due to earthquakes, formed by thick walls, arches, porticos, vaults, courtyards, and open spaces mainly built with <strong>sillar</strong>, the volcanic stone sourced from the Misti volcano. The preexisting indigenous populations, Spanish conquest and evangelization, the natural environment, and frequent earthquakes are key factors in defining Arequipa’s identity. The city was founded in 1540 in a valley intensively cultivated by pre-Hispanic communities. The layout of an indigenous village has survived near the Historic Center in the San Lázaro district. The World Heritage site comprises 49 original blocks of the Spanish design.<br><br>\n\nThe ornate architecture in Arequipa’s historic center is a masterpiece of the creative integration of European and native features, crucial for the cultural expression of the entire region (<strong>Criterion (i)</strong>). The historic center of Arequipa is an example of colonial settlement with indigenous influences, conquest, and evangelization processes (<strong>Criterion (iv)</strong>). Five periods can be identified here: the foundation (1540–82), the Baroque flourish (1582–1784), the introduction of Rococo and Neoclassicism (1784–1868), modern empiricism and Neoclassical fashion (1868–1960). The core of the historic city is the Plaza de Armas (Main Square) with its arches, the city hall, and the cathedral. On one corner of the square are the church and cloisters of La Compañía, the most representative complex of the late 18th-century mestizo Baroque period. The Monastery of Santa Catalina is an impressive religious citadel that integrates architectural styles from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The San Francisco complex includes a small plaza, the main church, the convent, and the cloisters of the third order. The chapels and convents of Santo Domingo date from the 16th to the 18th centuries: San Agustín, La Merced, and the Church of Santa María; Santa Teresa and Santa Rosa. The Royal Bridge (now Bolognesi Bridge) and Grau Bridge are also built of sillar.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Integrity.</strong> The protection area of Arequipa’s historic center covers 166.52 hectares and includes all representative elements and physical features of the urban and architectural complex and its historical evolution, expressing the Outstanding Universal Value of the site. The foundational urban design of the city, its monumental urban environments, and religious and civil buildings constructed between the 17th and 20th centuries constitute its historic urban character. The historic center of Arequipa is integrated with the natural and cultural environment of the Chili River valley, crowned by three snow-capped volcanoes. These attributes are preserved and maintain a harmonious relationship without significant alterations.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Authenticity.</strong> The urban layout planning of Arequipa’s historic center retains its originality and much of the urban fabric that expresses the city’s mixed character and historical identity. The construction techniques using volcanic stone and the fine sculptural work of porticos and other sillar structures also attest to the technological development and Baroque art that has survived since the 17th century. The churches maintain their religious use; however, many manor houses have lost their original residential use.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Protection and management requirements.</strong> The historic center of Arequipa is protected by the National Constitution and Law No. 28296, General Law of National Cultural Heritage of 2004. Supreme Resolution No. 2900 of 1972 declares the historic center of Arequipa as a Monumental Area with heritage value. Supreme Decree No. 012-77-IT/DS of 1977 defines the boundaries of the monumental area, and Municipal Ordinance No. 13-99 determines its protection and creates the Municipal Superintendence for Management and Control of Arequipa’s historic center. The fundamental task is to protect the city from natural phenomena: seismic activity, low-intensity volcanic activity, and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Likewise, the city center faces overpopulation, intense vehicular traffic and pollution, formal and informal commerce, and the demolition of real estate properties to be used as parking lots or commercial stores."

      "text":"<strong>Inscription:</strong> 33rd Session of the World Heritage Committee. Seville, June 28, 2009.<br><br>\n\nThe Sacred City of Caral-Supe represents the oldest civilization in the Americas, expressing the emergence of a socio-political state notable for its complexity and its impact on the development of settlements throughout the Supe Valley. Its early use of the quipu as a recording device is considered highly significant. The design of the city's architectural and spatial components is masterful, with monumental platform mounds and recessed circular patios expressing a consolidated state.<br><br>\n\nCaral is the best representation of late archaic architecture and urbanism in ancient Peruvian civilization. The platform mounds, sunken circular courts, and the urban plan, developed over centuries, influenced nearby settlements and later much of the Peruvian coast (<strong>Criterion (ii)</strong>). In the Supe Valley, it is the earliest known manifestation of civilization in the Americas; Caral is the most developed and complex settlement example of the formative period of civilization (the late archaic period) (<strong>Criterion (iii)</strong>). Caral is impressive in terms of design and complexity of its architectural and spatial elements, especially its monumental earthen platform mounds and sunken circular courts, features that dominated much of the Peruvian coast for many centuries (<strong>Criterion (iv)</strong>).<br><br>\n\n<strong>Integrity and authenticity.</strong> Caral remains remarkably intact largely due to its early abandonment and late discovery. Once abandoned, it appears to have been occupied only twice: once during the so-called Middle Formative or Early Horizon around 1000 BCE; and during the period of States and lordships between 900 and 1440 CE. Since both settlements were on the outskirts of the city, they did not disturb the ancient architectural structures. Furthermore, as the site lacked discoveries of gold and silver, there was little looting. The site is part of a cultural and natural landscape of great beauty, relatively intact. Most development has occurred in the lower valley areas near Lima (south of the site). The middle Supe Valley, where the site is located, is an area devoted to agriculture. Radiocarbon analysis performed by the Special Archaeological Project Caral-Supe (PEACS) at the Caral site confirms that the site's development can be dated between 3000 and 1800 BCE, specifically to the Late Archaic Period.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Management and protection requirements.</strong> The management system in place is adequate, and a modified management plan was implemented at the end of 2008, including regulations to ensure the property's preservation and conservation.\n"

It is one of the few World Heritage sites inscribed for both cultural and natural values. As a Conservation Unit, its territory comprises two distinct zones: the Restricted Zone and the Buffer Zone. The Restricted Zone consists of the Park itself, covering an area of 274,520 hectares. The Buffer Zone surrounds the former, covering 672,713 hectares. The property includes various types of forests and high Andean grasslands.<br><br>\n\nThe quantity and variety of archaeological sites found indicate human occupation since the preceramic era around 6,000 BC, continuing until before the Spanish colonization. Since 1985, 36 archaeological sites have been recorded, 29 in the high-elevation grasslands and seven in the park's forests. The property protects the headwaters of three rivers in the Huallaga system, an important tributary of the Amazon. The Andean meadows as well as the lowland, mountainous, and cloud forests host a significant number of species, notably the yellow-tailed woolly monkey, one of the largest monkey species in South America.<br><br>\n\nThe pre-Hispanic monuments in the Montecristo valley within the Abiseo River National Park represent outstanding examples of human adaptation, evolution, and settlement in the high-altitude forests of the Peruvian Andean Amazon basin (<strong>Criterion (iii)</strong>). The Abiseo River National Park encompasses a watershed covered by dense forests. The great beauty of its varied mountainous landscape is complemented by numerous small mountain lakes, pools, rivers, streams, and steep canyons (<strong>Criterion (vii)</strong>). Across the vast altitudinal gradient from about 350 to 4,349 meters above sea level, influenced by highly variable soils, exposures, rainfall patterns, and microclimates, the property supports very diverse ecosystems and habitats (<strong>Criterion (ix)</strong>).<br><br>\n\nMore than 5,000 plant species have been recorded, with almost 1,000 species in the grasslands. Taxonomic studies indicate species unknown to science, including vertebrates such as reptiles, amphibians, and even small mammals. Mammalian fauna include the spectacled bear, giant armadillo, northern Andean deer, jaguar, and various other cat species. Hundreds of bird species and countless arthropods are distributed throughout the habitats and ecological niches (<strong>Criterion (x)</strong>).<br><br>\n\n<strong>Integrity.</strong> The Abiseo River National Park contains features ranging from rock shelters to residential, ceremonial, production (platforms and storehouses), cemetery, and road structures that remain intact despite the passage of time, with natural and cultural features important for conservation and research. From the natural heritage perspective, it is notable that the full altitudinal gradient from lowlands to high Andean grasslands enjoys full protection.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Authenticity.</strong> The geographic configuration, isolation, and inaccessibility of the area have helped maintain the integrity of the Abiseo River National Park as well as the authenticity of its archaeological remains. No significant human interventions have occurred since its abandonment in the 16th century until its rediscovery in the 19th century. These conditions demonstrate that the diversity of archaeological sites across various altitudes and areas of the Abiseo River National Park testify to the process and historical continuity of human adaptation, evolution, and development.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Protection and management requirements.</strong> The lack of infrastructure and difficult access to most of the property have ensured a significant degree of protection against disturbances and illegal activities. In 1983, twenty years after its scientific discovery, the archaeological site of the Gran Pajatén Citadel was designated as National Cultural Heritage. That same year, the Abiseo River National Park was established with the goal of protecting the exceptional cloud forest, the Abiseo watershed, and the cultural values of the area. From the outset, the Ministry of Agriculture (later the Ministry of Environment) and the National Institute of Culture, currently the Ministry of Culture, have shared formal responsibility for management. Despite the evident tourism potential of the landscape and archaeological sites, public visits are restricted due to the fragility of the property."

The park contains several zones: the largest is the Restricted Zone, mainly undisturbed forests dedicated to conservation with restricted access for researchers; smaller zones include the Special Use Zone and the Service Zone around the Cocha Cashu Biological Station. There are also two Recreational Zones, a Cultural Zone, and a Recovery Zone covering Andean areas affected by livestock and fire-related use.<br><br>\n\nBoth farming communities and indigenous residents have a localized but manageable impact. However, there is concern about new roads being built through the Andes and the impact of the Camisea gas field exploitation."

      "text":"<strong>Inscription:</strong> 10th Session of the World Heritage Committee. Paris, November 24, 1986.<br><br>\n\nChan Chan was the political, administrative, and religious capital of the Chimú Culture, which reached its peak in the 15th century, shortly before falling under Inca rule. It is located in the Moche or Santa Catalina river valley and is the largest adobe city in pre-Columbian America. Its layout reflects a precise political and social strategy, emphasized by its division into nine 'citadels' or 'palaces' that form independent units. The Outstanding Universal Value of Chan Chan lies in the extensive and planned hierarchical remains of this city, including remnants of the industrial, agricultural, and water management systems that sustained it.<br><br>\n\nThe monumental area of about six square kilometers in the city center, once covering twenty square kilometers, includes nine large rectangular complexes (\"citadels\" or \"palaces\") outlined by high and thick adobe walls, including temples, dwellings, and warehouses arranged around open spaces. The adobe walls are decorated with friezes depicting abstract, anthropomorphic, and zoomorphic motifs. The city planning of the largest adobe city in pre-Columbian America is a masterpiece of urban organization. The rigorous zoning, differentiated use of inhabited space, and hierarchical construction illustrate a political ideal (Criterion (i)). Chan Chan represents a unique testimony and is the most representative city of Chimú rule, synthesizing and expressing eleven thousand years of cultural evolution in northern Peru (Criterion (iii)).<br><br>\n\n<strong>Integrity.-</strong> Chan Chan retains all elements bearing its Outstanding Universal Value within an area of fourteen square kilometers, which, although smaller than the original city area, contains representative features of architectural units, ceremonial pathways, temples, and agricultural units. The adobe construction of the city, as well as environmental conditions including climatic factors, make the archaeological site susceptible to decay and deterioration.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Authenticity.-</strong> The archaeological site still expresses the essence of the monumental urban landscape of the ancient Chimú capital. Also, the hierarchical arrangements reflect the political, social, technological, ideological, and economic complexity achieved by the Chimú society between the 9th and 15th centuries. The original adobe architecture with its religious characteristics and decorations, although subject to deterioration, is undergoing conservation interventions with mud materials and still faithfully represents construction methods and the spirit of its people.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Protection and management requirements.-</strong> The Ministry of Culture of Peru, through its decentralized office in La Libertad, is responsible for the conservation and protection of Chan Chan, which is safeguarded by national laws and decrees. However, its location by the sea exposes it to salts and humidity that affect the mud walls, and the intense cyclical rains of the El Niño phenomenon weaken its structures. Additional problems include land tenure and illegal agricultural practices. Consequently, regulatory measures have not yet been effectively enforced to guarantee the conservation and protection of the property, which was included in the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1986 due to the precarious condition of the adobe architecture and its vulnerability. Likewise, the ruins are threatened by constant looting of archaeological remains and by a proposed road crossing the site.<br><br>\n\nSince its inscription, various measures have been taken to remove the property from the List of World Heritage in Danger, including corrective actions and the development of a management plan. Implementation has mainly involved maintenance of drainage systems controlling the water table, stabilization of perimeter walls of palaces and funerary platforms, vegetation control, maintenance of public use areas, architectural documentation for conservation and management, capacity building for local artisans, and awareness measures for students and the local community."

Brasilia, September 5, 1988.<br>\n<strong>Extension of the Inscribed Area:</strong> 15th Session of the World Heritage Committee. Cartago, December 9, 1991.<br><br>\n\nThe Historic Centre of Lima is located in the Rímac valley and was founded by the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro in January 1535. Lima was the political, administrative, religious, and economic capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru and the most important city of the Spanish domains in South America. The evangelization process at the end of the 16th century allowed the arrival of several religious orders and the construction of churches and convents. The University of San Marcos, the oldest in the Americas, was founded on May 12, 1551, and began its operations on January 2, 1553, in the Convent of Santo Domingo.<br><br>\n\nIn the historic centre of Lima, one can appreciate: the Plaza Mayor with the Cathedral, the Sagrario Chapel, the Archbishop's Palace, the Church of Santo Domingo, and the San Francisco Convent. Also, several public works built during the colonial period such as the stone bridge over the Rímac River, the Paseo de Aguas, the Alameda de los Descalzos, the Acho Bullring, and the General Cemetery called Presbítero Maestro. The architecture is characterized by facades, corridors, patios, and balconies with slight stylistic variations during the republican period until the late 19th century, when urban “modernization” and new European architecture began.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Integrity:</strong> Although seriously damaged by the earthquakes of 1940, 1966, 1970, and 1974, the Historic Centre of Lima retains all the elements and physical features that convey its Outstanding Universal Value, in an area that includes not only the urban layout but also testimonies of civil domestic, public, religious, military, and industrial architecture from the 17th to the 20th centuries.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Authenticity:</strong> The authenticity of the Historic Centre of Lima remains intact as it largely preserves the original characteristics of its urban foundation design, and the expansion area from the 16th to the 19th centuries, including ancient pre-Hispanic roads leading north (Chinchaysuyo) and east (Antisuyo). Public, private, and religious buildings retain their architectural, technological, typological, aesthetic, historical, and urban values, reflecting the implementation of European styles from different stages of the city's historical evolution from the 16th to the 20th century.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Protection and management requirements:</strong> Aside from natural deterioration affecting the material integrity of buildings, the Historic Centre of Lima faces additional factors degrading it environmentally and urbanely, such as commercial exploitation in old structure areas to build “shopping centers,” and the heavy presence of public and private transportation causing pollution. Another factor is the population increase due to migration from other regions of the country to the Historic Centre (1940: 400,000; 1990: 7,000,000 inhabitants).<br><br>\n\nThe Historic Centre of Lima is protected by the Political Constitution of the State; Law No. 28296, General Law of Cultural Heritage of the Nation; Resolution No. 2900 of 1972 declaring it a Monumental Zone with buildings of patrimonial value as National Monuments; Ministerial Resolutions No. 505-74-ED (1974), No. 0928-80-ED (1980), and No. 1251-1985-ED (1985). The Metropolitan Municipality of Lima shares the responsibility of managing the Historic Centre of Lima with the Municipality of the Rímac District. The Ministry of Culture is in charge of preserving the nation's cultural heritage and has an Urban Control Office and the Municipal Real Estate Company of Lima (EMILIMA) responsible for planning and preparing management projects such as the Metropolitan Development Plan and the Historic Centre of Lima Plan (1987), which establish basic guidelines, interventions, and projects related to urban situation and structure, environment, land use, transportation system, habitability, and dynamics."
